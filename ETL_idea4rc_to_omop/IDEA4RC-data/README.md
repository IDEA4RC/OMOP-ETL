# Fake Data IDEA4RC

Fake data is created based on the defined Excel sheet of the IDEA4RC tables. The values arbitrarily implemented are directly the numerical references from the Athena vocabularies.

According to Eugenio, this is how it works, and they are not the "Expected Values" defined in the Excel sheet. If they were to be the "Expected Values" in the end, manually replace the numerical references with the corresponding values. Then, read that data and perform a transformation for each value to its corresponding numerical reference from the Athena Vocabulary, for later insertion into OMOP.
